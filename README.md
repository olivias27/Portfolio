# Portfolio
Highlight of some work I have completed over my four years at Pitt

- [Transit Manager](https://github.com/olivias27/Portfolio/tree/main/src/transit): My final project for one of my computer science classes was to build a fully functional transit manager GUI. Over the semester, we worked to design a transit manager to determine how many people were at stops/stations, how full a bus/train is, what the next stop/station is, and how many people got off at stops/stations. At the end of the semester, our job was to create a GUI, which is a way to visualize the output. ![visual](https://drive.google.com/open?id=109pYJEYgGTp78JEYhvpgx3uD-IAbc5OQ&authuser=1)
