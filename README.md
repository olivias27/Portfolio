Highlight of some work I have completed over my four years at Pitt

- [Transit Manager](https://github.com/olivias27/Portfolio/tree/main/src/transit): My final project for one of my computer science classes was to build a fully functional transit manager GUI. Over the semester, we worked to design a transit manager to determine how many people were at stops/stations, how full a bus/train is, what the next stop/station is, and how many people got off at stops/stations. At the end of the semester, our job was to create a GUI, which is a way to visualize the output. ![visual](2ce1821a-edd6-4997-8684-581db1a5afca.png)
